# tool_supporter [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/eLearning-TUDarmstadt/moodle-tool_supporter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/eLearning-TUDarmstadt/moodle-tool_supporter)

## About
With the Supporter you can simply find & manage your students and courses - all in one, intuitve window.

It is the successor to the [Moodle Analyst](https://moodle.org/plugins/report_moodleanalyst) which was also created at the TU Darmstadt.

The Supporter is developed with asynchronous calls and thus only retrieves the information from the database which are needed, not requiring reloading of the whole page; bringing a whole new user experience to moodle admins.

It has the standard Moodle Capability-Checks built-in so there are no extra capabilites needed and multiple levels of Support can be accomplished (see chapter "Capabilites").

## Features
* Find Students & Courses
* Display additional information about your students
  * Enrolled Courses/Students
  * Amount of enrolled Students
* Enrol users into courses
* Create a new Course
* Delete users from courses
* Hotlinks to additional Features
  * Edit, Settings, Visibility of courses
  * Log in as the selected user

## Prerequisites
* This version is tested on Moodle 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9 (master) and 3.10, 3.11 (branch 310)
  * For 3.4 and older versions of Moodle, checkout the Branch "MOODLE_34_STABLE"
  * Also works with Moodle 4.0 and 4.1, but for the moment without link in navigation, navigate manually to /admin/tool/supporter
* A php version of 5.5 or greater is needed
* It is highly recommended to activate compression to reduce transmitted data (e.g. from 4.36MB to 1.05 MB)
  * Add "zlib.output_compression = On" in php.ini
  * Or add deflate to your apache/nginx/lighttpd, see https://docs.moodle.org/en/Performance_recommendations

## Installation
* Copy/Clone to `https://YOURSITE/admin/tool/` directory
  * Alternatively use `git clone https://github.com/eLearning-TUDarmstadt/moodle-tool_supporter admin/tool/supporter` in your moodle root
* Enable database upgrade
* Go to `https://YOURSITE/admin/tool/supporter` or `Site Administration->Reports->Supporter`

## Capabilites
With this Plugin, we strove to implement all necessary Moodle-capabilities. As such, there is no need to give users additional caps. 
If there is a need to divide different levels of support, these caps need to be set on a system-context:

Level 1 Support (read-only): 
- moodle/site:viewparticipants
- moodle/user:viewdetails (requires site:viewparticipants)
- moodle/course:viewhiddencourses
- moodle/course:view (requires course:viewhiddencourses)
		
level 2 Support (also write):
- Read-Capabilites from above
- moodle/user:loginas		
- moodle/course:create	
- moodle/course:update
- enrol/manual:enrol
  * This requires the defined role to be able to "Allow role assignments" in its settings

## Configuration
* Blocks are disabled by default and the nav drawer gets closed for maximum viewing 
* The settings can be accessed with the cog in the header or by going to `/admin/settings.php?section=tool_supporter`

## Limitations
As of now, only 2 layers of course categories are represented.
